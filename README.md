# Offscreen-programming

The purpose of off screen programming is that you can program via physical programming cards. This type of programming is ideal for introducing kids to engineering and programming. The off screen programming project consists of base stations, control station and robot that executes the programmed sequence.
You make a choice between the different base stations via the control station. The selected base station can then forward its read-in card sequence to the robot.

## Components
### Base station
* esp32
* RFID MFRC522 card reader/writer
* 2 push buttons
* LED's + resistors

### control station
* Raspberry Pi 4b with Raspberry Pi OS (previously called Raspbian)
* A 16GB or larger microSD card.

### Robot
* the robot is now simulated via xojo and an arduino nano IoT with LEDs

## The fully developed and detailed project can be found in the wiki.
